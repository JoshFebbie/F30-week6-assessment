Bug Report for "Test Case 1":
Date of Test: November 4 2022.

Description:
App does NOT generate accurate score count.


Initial Test Results:
    After both winning and losing at least 5 times, I was able
    to confidentaly conclude that "Wins" to "Losses"
    count is NOT accurate. All scores appear to go to the "losses" counter. 


Expected Test Results:
    Counter keeps accurate count of both "Winner" and "Loser"
    after a Duel.


Steps to Reproduce Results:
    1.Make sure Nodemon is running.
    
    2.Verify App is running and responsive in browser of local machine.
    
    3.Play game multiple times, making sure you "lose" at least
    five times, and "Win" at least five times.
    
    4.Make sure to keep INDEPENDENT and ACCURATE score of "Wins" vs. "Losses", 
    which can later be used to compare with the score count that the App has generated.


Test Environment:
    Chrome Version 107.0.5304.88 (Official Build) (64-bit)
